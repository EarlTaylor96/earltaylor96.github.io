    Hello, my name is Earl Taylor, and I'm from Maryland. I'm very family-oriented and spend most of my time with my stepkids and wife. I also like playing video games, fishing, and learning new things about software. One day, I would like to work as a software engineer.

My favorite video game is Overwatch. It's a first-person shooter that's oriented around teamwork.
  My favorite fish to fish for is bass; sometimes, the family accompanies me. 
  I enjoy learning new things about software. 
  I recently started doing this and have dedicated at least half an hour to watching a day-in-the-life video or a video reviewing 
  a leet code.
